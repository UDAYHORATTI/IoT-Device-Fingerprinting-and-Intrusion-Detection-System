# IoT-Device-Fingerprinting-and-Intrusion-Detection-System
This project aims to fingerprint IoT devices based on their network behavior and device-specific features, then uses this fingerprint to detect potential intrusions or anomalies in a network. By tracking how IoT devices behave in the network,
